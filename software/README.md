This is the small software used to discuss with the firmware and it allows to change from one mode to another.
It autodetects one or few 3D Mouses

IMPORTANT !!!
Use Python 3.10 not 3.11, whisper will not work otherwise

Installation:
pip install -r requirements.txt

---
Whisper must be installed from git, not the pip package, it is too old
- pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
- pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
